    An HTML element is a type of HTML (HyperText Markup Language) document component, one of several types of HTML nodes
    (there are also text nodes, comment nodes and others).[vague] The first used version of HTML was written by Tim
    Berners-Lee in 1993 and there have since been many versions of HTML. The most commonly used version is HTML 4.01,
    which became official standard in December 1999.[1] An HTML document is composed of a tree of simple HTML nodes,
    such as text nodes, and HTML elements, which add semantics and formatting to parts of document (e.g., make text
    bold, organize it into paragraphs, lists and tables, or embed hyperlinks and images). Each element can have HTML
    attributes specified. Elements can also have content, including other elements and text.

    As is generally understood, the position of an element is indicated as spanning from a start tag and is terminated
    by an end tag.[2] This is the case for many, but not all, elements within an HTML document. The distinction is
    explicitly emphasised in HTML 4.01 Specification:

    The Document Object Model (DOM) is a cross-platform and language-independent interface that treats an XML or HTML
    document as a tree structure wherein each node is an object representing a part of the document. The DOM represents
    a document with a logical tree. Each branch of the tree ends in a node, and each node contains objects. DOM methods
    allow programmatic access to the tree; with them one can change the structure, style or content of a document.[2]
    Nodes can have event handlers attached to them. Once an event is triggered, the event handlers get executed.[3]
